This is text file 1 in master branch


Edited this file in FEATURE branch only. I want this file only (out of the three total files) to download to my local machine when checking out a branch. Bascially I'm looking for a way for only the diffs to download, instead of the entire repository.

EDIT 2: I made this edit/commit in the Github desktop editor

updated this file in master branch after feature branch was created and file was updated


removed all conflict markers during merge and marked file as resolved
